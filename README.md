# Welcome to BSafes
Hi, **BSafes** is Encrypted Note Taking and Office Filing Solution for You and Your Teams.
## Features
 - Privacy by design.
 - Team collaboration.
 - End-to-End Encryption.
 - Opening multiple notes at the same time.
 - Web app, no software installation.
 - Open source encryption reviewed by security experts.
 - Support attachments of all media files, up to 500MB per file. No limit on number of attachments.
 
Though there are a lot of note taking apps already, we found only few apps are designed for privacy with **End-to-End Encryption**, and even fewer for **teams**.

Further more, few apps allow you to open multiple notes at the same time, this really kills productivity. Imagine you want to reference different notes for a project, and you have to repeatedly close a note and open another note. **BSafes** takes advantages of **tabs** of modern browser, you could open as many notes as you want on all devices. 
## Privacy & Security
Most cloud services such as Evernote, Google, Dropbox, features **encryption-in-transit** and **encryption-at-rest**, but without **End-to-End Encryption**, they could still see your data. And with modern **A.I.**, you don't really know how they use your data.

Also, only End-to-End encryption allows you and security experts to openly review the **client side encryption** code, to make sure your data is encrypted before being sent to servers.
